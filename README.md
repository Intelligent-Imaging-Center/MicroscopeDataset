## Pathological Sample (PS)
Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) stained sliced samples
from dogs’ lungs and trachea were acquired using a high-magnification slide scanner
(Unic, Precice 500B) to obtain high-resolution images. The acquisition of the
related animal specimens has been reviewed and approved by the Animal Ethics
Committee of Affiliated First Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University. The
dataset includes 3382 images of size 256 × 256, with 2703 used for training and 679
for validation.
## Resolution Chart (RC)
High-definition ISO 12233 test chart has been cut and rotated to create this dataset from its full vector version.
It features black and white stripes, both inclined
and vertical, with varying resolutions. The dataset consists of 1682 images of size
256x256, with 1345 used for training and 337 for validation.
